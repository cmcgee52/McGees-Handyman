                    <!-- About us page of company here -->
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> The client needed an updated design, a better way to show off their products and work, and a comprehensive quote system that included an automatic way to send the quotes to the right people at all their different
                        locations. The quote system also sends a daily report showing the number of quotes for different categories of products for each location.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Laravel, Bootstrap 4, Google Maps API, Google Geocode API</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This project was fun and quite challenging. I had never built a quote system like this one before. I had also not been experienced in using Cookies in Laravel. We used them to save the user's perferred location even if they are not
                        logged into the application. Using this perferred location, we would automatically make sure their quote request went to that location, as well as highlighting their location more clearly on the google map on the locations page.
                        There are call to action buttons in many places on the site including the galleries which allow the user to get a quote directly on the item they are looking at. This was a great project and we made our client a lot of money.</p>
