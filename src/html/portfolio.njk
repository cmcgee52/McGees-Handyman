                                <p>During my senior year in college, I built my final Capstone project, AttendIT, with my friend Jie Lie. Software Engineering was a pre-req to this class where we learned how to construct a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmcCv_9F9DVbXRV6fQLwDnmuRb3-aihxqL8KwU8Tqis/edit?usp=sharing">software requirements document</a>.
                                    This document explains how the software was used between all the different types of users and the different object models that would need to be created and how they interacted with each other.
