                    <h2>About The Project</h2>
                    <!-- About us page of company here -->
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> This client found me on Fiverr and approach me with the following situation. She had already gone through one web development agency, and two other free lancers. The original website was a laravel app that
                        had two user types: parents and teachers. Teachers can sign-up and create a profile with packages that parents can buy. Parents can search and browse teachers by a few different data points such as zip code and what type of subject
                        that do tutor services for. The client was uphappy with how some of the pages looked and how she had no ability to edit the pages. The web dev company would want to charge her a substantial amount of money just to change pictures
                        and text on pages that she already didn't like the design on. She tried to fix this problem herself by hiring a free lancer to create wordpress pages that could replace the pages she did not like and redirect to them. Well, the
                        free lancer created this wordpress pages, but was unable to complete a redirection system to redirect back and forth between the Wordpress application pages and the Laravel application pages. I helped finish this work by creating
                        a custom plugin on her Wordpress application that provided an API endpoint that would return all the html for that page so that I could keep everything inside of the laravel app and not have to use subdomains or anything like that.
                        Finally, I create a WordpressPage middleware which would check if there is a wordpress URL on that API that matches the requested URL. If so, it would get that page and dump it out into the view, otherwise it would just use the
                        laravel page. In additional to completing this functionality, I also completed other incomplete work that another free lancer did for her. This work was using Laravel Cashier and Stripe so that she could collect a payment from
                        parents that subscribed. I also did some redesign on the laravel app, and made updates to the Wordpress theme to support a better mobile menu.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Laravel, Wordpress, Wordpress API, Laravel Cashier, Laravel Forge, Bitbucket, Tailwind CSS.</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>I took on this project as more of a charitable endeavor because I empathized with the client's unfortunate experiences of being let down by previous developers multiple times. Despite receiving only a small payment for my work, I was motivated by the challenge it presented. Initially, I wasn't even sure if it was possible to utilize WordPress pages and middleware in the way I envisioned. Nevertheless, I assured the client that I would give it a try and that she wouldn't owe me anything if I couldn't complete the task. Fortunately, I successfully finished the work as planned, and we continued collaborating on various updates thereafter. This project holds great significance to me because I have a sibling with disabilities. It allows me to relate to the love and the need for assistance that parents have for their children. Tutor Chest provides a valuable platform for connecting teachers and parents, which I find incredibly helpful.</p>
